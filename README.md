# Nand2Tetris
Nand2Tetris Solutions

This repository contains my own solutions for the nand2tetris project.

Nand2Tetris is a project where you build a modern computer system, from the ground up.

	Course page: https://www.nand2tetris.org/

projects done:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Notes:
8 - be carefull with the requirements of the particular test. The first tests want only bootsrap code that set ups stack pointer to 256. The final tests want the VM to include call to Sys.init and therefore pushing four 0's into stack. 

projects to do:
9, 10, 11, 12
